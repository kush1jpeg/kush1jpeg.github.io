  <p>
  Wubba Lubba dub-dub , I am kushagra -> kush1jpeg (in the online world), say my name thrice and will appear infront of u
  telling how arch and nvim is the best (though i am still learning both). I like coffee more than i like people... <br> <br>

  I sometimes code, a little bit, i am falling in love with the world of low level
  programming, system design ,compilers(<em>will_build.future_inPain</em>), internals**
  - the whole “<em>programming near the metal</em>” thing, but still know <a href="https://youtu.be/CUhVm9XPeZA" target="_blank">jack fuck of anything</a>.

<div class="flex items-center gap-2 p-0 m-0" >
  <p>

To maintain some illusion of employability (and a little sanity for the people around me) i have to get my hands dirty inside shitty abstracted languages
like web dev and insert buzzword framework in the resume.
Yes, I know AI is coming for my job. I just hope it takes me out quickly. <br> <br>

    <h3> What I do</h3>
    I build, pretty useless things, often trying to reinvent the wheel but with a catch......i make it worse! but proudly! <br>
    tldr - they are mostly stupid things with oddly over-ambitious ideas, either way, don't rescue me — document it.
    <br> <br> If you made it this far, congratulations -
    You now know more about me than my extended family.
    For everything else -
